# eventmobi-helpers
This is a collection of different scripts that can help you getting more use from the EventMobi platform. Do not use any of those scripts on live events. Using these scripts is not endorsed by EventMobi. This repository does not contain any official EventMobi code and features. This is meant as a playground for EventMobi power users.

## AddGroupsToSession.py
This is a Python script which uses the EventMobi API to add people, who are part of specific groups, to a selected session manually. In order to run the script, simply download it and execute it with 

__python3 AddGroupsToSession.py__ 

and follow the instructions. This code was almost entirely written by ChatGPT and has not gone through any code reviews. Use at your own risk.

Uses the json and requests library.

## checkin.html
A HTML file with JavaScript that runs locally. You can use it to calculate how long attendees, who checked in and out of your event, were on-site. This is deprecated, if you need these reports, refer to your EventMobi support team.
